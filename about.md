## Who I Am

You probably guessed: <i>Doswah</i> is not my real name. It is my blogger handle derived from saying my first name in a filipino accent. My real name is [Joshua Rivera](http://joshuatrivera.com). I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am a fan of technology, creative user experiences, and bringing fresh and exciting ideas to life. 

## What I Do

I spend my time being a freelance website developer and learning how to develop sophisticated mobile applications. All this, while I try to find a entry-level software development job to start my career.

## The Fun Stuff 

I am a huge fan of sports. I play golf (<i>+15 handicap</i>), basketball (<i>5'2" Point Guard</i>), and Disc Golf (<i>2-time Nuke Disc Champion</i>). In addition, I root for the Denver Broncos and Miami Heat. I'm also am a huge fan of [hiking](http://hike2grind.com), musicals, Childish Gambino, life hacks, and Doctor Who. I even play guitar in my free time, but I'll save that for <i>later</i>.

## Motivation (<i>sort of</i> )
Just because. I aspire to code as good as [Kenny Luong](http://kennyluong.com), be better at everything than everyone like [Jake Tsuyemura](http://jaketsuyemura.com), and keep pace with [Matthew Inouye](http://mkinouye.com).
