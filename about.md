## Who I Am

First things first, <i>Doswah</i> is not my real name. It is my blogger handle derived from a filipino accent (go figure). My real name is [Joshua Rivera](http://joshuatrivera.com) and go by <i>Doswah</i> to my friends and family.
 
## What I do

I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Hawaii at Manoa aspiring to code as good as [Kenny Luong](http://kennyluong.com).

## Why do what I do 

At an early age, I developed a love for coding from editing HTML on MySpace and finding cool ways to hack my video games. Since then, I have always been interested in new technology.

## For lolz

I am a huge sports fanatic. I play golf, basketball, tennis whenever I get the chance. Also, I am a dedicated Denver Broncos and Miami Heat fan.
