## Who I Am

<i>Doswah</i> is not my real name, it is my blogger handle derived from saying my first name in a filipino accent. My real name is [Joshua Rivera](http://joshuatrivera.com)
 
## What I do

I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I aspire to code as good as [Kenny Luong](http://kennyluong.com), be better at everything than everyone like [Jake Tsuyemura](http://jaketsuyemura.com), and keep pace with [Matthew Inouye](http://mkinouye.com).

## More about me 

I am a huge fan of sports. I play golf (<i>+15 handicap</i>), basketball (<i>5'2" Point Guard</i>), and Disc Golf (<i>2-time Nuke Disc Champion</i>). In addition, I root for the Denver Broncos and Miami Heat. I'm also am a huge fan of hiking, musicals, Childish Gambino, life hacks, and Doctor Who.
