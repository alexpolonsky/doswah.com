<p class="image-pull-left"><img src="http://doswah.com/images/TFIOS/fault-in-our-stars-poster.jpg" alt="MoviePoster" /></p>
<p><br />
I recently watched the <em>The Fault In Our Stars</em> with my friends on opening night and I decided to write my reactions. The film stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort as the teenage duo Hazel Lancaster and Augustus (Gus) Waters. This highly anticipated book-to-film adaptation is a fresh installment that stands out in a plethora of romantic dramas over the years. One thing is for sure, the film’s tagline lives up it’s name. This definitely <em>one sick love story.</em></p>

<p class="notice"><strong>Warning:</strong> There are spoilers from the film! <em>Do not</em> read on if you plan to watch the movie without knowing about the story. If you do read on, please share your comments with me at the bottom.</p>

<h2 id="review">Review</h2>

<p>I have <em>not</em> read the book and this is purely my reaction of just the film. Here is the storyline from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582846/">IMDB</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hazel and Gus are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous given that Hazel has another other constant companion: an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they met and fell in love at a cancer support group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="image-pull-left"><img src="http://doswah.com/images/TFIOS/fault-in-our-stars-swingset.jpg" alt="Swingset" /></p>

<h3 id="all-the-feels">All The Feels</h3>

<p class="image-pull-left">The film’s main characters: Hazel (Woodley) and Gus (Elgort) have great chemistry and their strong performances allow the viewer to really buy into their emotions and struggles. The character’s attitudes towards life and death is an emotional roller-coaster. Throughout the film, the director maneuvers with a linear and coherent story to capture the heart-warming (<em>and the heart-breaking</em>) moments of Hazel’s narrative. 
<br /><br />
I felt there were missing back stories for the main characters that could have helped the film. After discussing with the book-readers, the movie did not accomplish sensitive themes the book did, so I now I have the desire to read the popular book one day. 
<br /><br />
Back to my missing back story thought. In the unraveling of a romance between a girl living in the moment and a boy living in his dream; the formula: the struggling girl meets the perfect guy does not tackle the film’s heavy themes of the side effects of dying. Why is Augustus the perfect guy from the beginning? But I stopped asking all these questions halfway through the movie because the balance of the film works so well.
<br /><br />
The film works with light-hearted and entertaining scenes (<em>the virgin venn diagram XD</em>). Nonetheless, the moments that hit you were the enlightening character growth: Hazel handling with herself when she meets her favorite author, Hazel’s parents making their future life plans, and Augustus helping his friend Isaac in impactful way.
<br /><br />

<h3 id="the-verdict">The Verdict</h3>

<p><i> The Fault In Our Stars is an incredibly touching,  well-executed film filled with tearjerking moments thanks to powerful performances and a relentless story with timeless thoughts about love, life, and courage that proves a teenage romantic drama can be a small infinity worth every moment.</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>I realize why girls “wait” for their Augustus Waters</li>
  <li>“Okay? Okay. OMG stop flirting with me!”</li>
  <li>Quotes, metaphors, and math theories galore!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="watch-if-you-crave-a-fresh-and-philosophical-romantic-drama-and-maybe-a-tear-here-or-there">Watch if you crave a fresh and philosophical romantic drama (and maybe a tear here or there).</h3>

<hr />

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>The film succeeds in capturing my attention through clever quotes and scenes with meaning. I may have a complete understanding, just remember that <strong>I’m just writing how I feel about them</strong>. There were so many, but here are some of my favorites:</p>

<h3 id="metaphors">1. Metaphors</h3>
<p class="image-pull-left">Within the first few scenes, you meet Augustus Waters. Shortly after getting Hazel to watch a movie with him, Gus places a cigarette in his mouth much to Hazel’s disgust. He tells her <em>“It’s a metaphor, see. You put the killing thing right between your teeth but you don’t give it the power to do it’s killing.”</em>
<br /><br />
<img src="http://doswah.com/images/TFIOS/metaphor.jpg" alt="Metaphor" /></p>
<p><br />
This was a way for Gus to tell himself that he has control over his fate (up to a certain extent). We all have control over our fate to a certain degree. I found this powerful because our attitude toward of life can make the biggest of impacts. Metaphors give us the positive power to things just by looking at something in a creative way. Personally, I keep mementos to remind myself of people and events that changed me and remind me to do good.</p>

<h3 id="our-little-infinity">2. Our Little Infinity</h3>

<p>Later in the film, when Gus summons Hazel and Isaac to a church so he can listen to their eulogies they prepared for him, Hazel recites a touching piece that represented her love for Gus. She highlighted: <em>“Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.”</em> (there are an infinite amount of numbers (0.1, 0.11, 0.12) between two domains. Whether it is from 0 to 1 or 0 to a million.) The fact is the infinity between 0 and a million is greater than the infinity between  0 to 1. Hazel and Gus’ relationship is time set shorter than other couples, but she <strong>chooses</strong> to see it as an infinity. She acknowledges that she is thankful Gus gave her “forever” (an infinity) within their number of days, their set.
<br /><br />
The sets that can drive us insane <em>(attending a class, being parent, or even growing up)</em> are a finite amount of hours, days, or years. We can digest their meaning through analogies. Hazel’s analogy helps bring structure to <em>clarify our purpose</em> and <em>appraise how we live our life</em>. I believe value is in the eye of the beholder. Seeing infinities are rare, but it is because there are only a handful of sets that truly clarify ourselves now and who we want to be.  My infinities are the memories are filled with people whom I will always cherish and will never forget. I am fortunate I can always recall these memories since they reflect who I am and bring me peace of mind. 
<br /><br />
So. We can choose to wish we have more numbers or we can perceive a set feel like an infinity.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-august-waters">3. Who Is August Waters?</h3>

<p><em>EDIT: I realized I spelt Augustus as August I elected not to change it because I thought it was funny.</em> My friend <a href="http://jordynchung.tumblr.com">Jordyn</a> shared this post with me from her Tumblr:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are 313 pages… We don’t meet Augustus until page 8… He does not speak until page 11… He leaves us on page 261… That is 253 pages from when we meet him until he leaves… And within those 253 pages… He is physically in 172 of them… And that is all it took. 172 pages for us to fall in love with Augustus Waters. And none of us will be the same again…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering I read this before watching the film. I thought to myself: <em>what is the deal with this guy?</em> Is he the <em>perfect</em> man? Well not exactly. After watching the film, he was the personification of passion. His relentless full-court press attempts for Hazel’s heart was an instinct of his principles. He is understands where he stands in this world and he shapes himself on his own terms. I see him as someone who is truly happy because of decisions bring him some kind of peace. Augusts is a survivor and applies the ideas of heroism and courage from his video games to his life. Generally people adore heroes and feed from courage. With that notion, he became fixated with timeless legacy. But in his last scenes, Hazel comforts him that her care should be enough. Showing him and all of us, there’s contentment with being in love with a single person. Contentment is difficult to overcome everyday because of our human desire to be better than people or ourselves. Which the movie speaks to me: we need someone to remind us that we are loved because anyone can be easily consumed by themselves.
<br /><br />
Augusts’ character uncovered that such great heights are fulfilling. Unfortunately they involve persistent courage and an outrageous amount of thought, hence, why Augusts Waters is a character in a book. Though fictional, anyone can collect what made him inspiration to living a quality way to live our lives.</p>
