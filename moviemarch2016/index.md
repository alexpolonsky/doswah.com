A thought-provoking sci-fi revolving around the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test). Driven with immersive visuals and engigmatic story telling, each character's actions continuously made you question their true intentions and the debated question: What does it mean to be human?

## 4. The Giant Mechanical Man
**Pam Beesley and Danny Castellano starring in a rom-com.**<br><br>
The title reminded me of the statue street performers in Waikiki. A slow, unguided film at first, the final act revealed how your personal connection with your art should be shared with the one's quirky enough to see it too.

## 3. Hercules
**Read on the internet that Dwayne Johnson eats 800 pounds of cod each year O_O**<br><br>
It was the action-packed blockbuster marketing made it out to be. Coming from the director of the Rush Hour trilogy (and sadly X-Men: The Last Stand), smug one-liners and over-the-top fight sequences helped keep the movie from getting too serious. And we can't forget that John Hurt's' English accent makes any movie better.

## 2. Wish I Was Here
**Watched the trailer and thought Zach Braff was due for another comedy-drama and award-winning soundtrack.**<br><br>
This coming of (late) age story showcased the emotional journey when past decisions catch up to you. The hard-hitting moments were overshadowed by the light-hearted humor of one's man journey to win a Comic Con cosplay contest.

## 1. Grease Live!
**Just partied a Carly Rae Jepsen concert so I wanted keep the good times rolling.**<br><br>
Having never seen the 1978 classic, the impressive Pink Ladies cast got my attention (in Carly Rae Jepsen and Vanessa Hudgens). From the catchy "Summer Loving" number, this cast and crew pulled off a fun 2-hours with plenty to love for the musical fan in me.
