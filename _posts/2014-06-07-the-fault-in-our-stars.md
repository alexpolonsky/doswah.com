I recently watched the *The Fault In Our Stars* with my friends on opening night and I decided to write a my reactions. The film stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort as the teenage duo Hazel Lancaster and Augustus (Gus) Waters. This highly anticipated book-to-film adaptation is a fresh installment that stands out in a plethora of romantic dramas over the years. One thing is for sure, the film's tagline lives up it's name. This definitely *one sick love story.*


**Warning:** There are spoilers from the film! *Do not* read on if you plan to watch the movie without knowing about the story. If you do read on, please share your comments with me at the bottom.

## Review 

I have *not* read the book and this is purely my reaction of just the film. Here is the storyline from [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582846/):

> Hazel and Gus are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous given that Hazel has another other constant companion: an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they met and fell in love at a cancer support group.

### All The Feels

The film's main characters: Hazel (Woodley) and Gus (Elgort) have great chemistry and their strong performances allow the viewer to really buy into their emotions and struggles. The characters attitudes towards life and death keep you strapped on an relentless two hour emotional roller-coaster. Throughout the entire film, the director utilizes lucid scene transitions, maneuvers with a coherent storytelling speed,  and executes the heart-warming (*and especially the heart-breaking*) segments of Hazel's narrative beautifully. I enjoy films that doesn't confuse you with parallel stories (like *Lord of the Rings* or *Star Wars*) because I can focus on absorb a story much as I can. And this story is heavy. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, I felt there were missing back stories or deeper meanings in addition to the film having a hint of predictability. After discussing with readers of the book, the movie did not accomplish sensitive themes as much as the book did, so I desire to read the book now (*one day*). The film unravels a romance between a girl living in the moment and a boy living in his dream who gives his all relentlessly for the girl he loves. This formula, the struggling girl meets the perfect guy, is charmingly set up, but the film's heavy themes could have been expanded on for us who did not read the book to get a deeper understanding of the characters. Why is Augustus the perfect guy from the beginning? Nonetheless, the balance of what is included in the film works so well, you forget to notice.
<br><br>
The film works with the light-hearted and entertaining scenes (*the virgin venn diagram XD*). Though nice, the film thrives on does not sugarcoat the awful obstacles the characters encounter which builds the fitting conditions for meaningful scenes. Above all the moments that hit you were the enlightening scenes where you see believable character growth: Hazel handling with herself when she meets her favorite auth, Hazel's parents making their future life plans, and Augustus helping his friend Issac in influential way.

### The Verdict

<i> The Fault In Our Stars is an incredibly touching,  well-executed film filled with tearjerking moments thanks to powerful performances and a relentless story with timeless thoughts about love, life, and courage that proves a teenage romantic drama can be a small infinity worth every moment.

* I realize why girls "wait" for their Augustus Waters 
* "Okay? Okay. OMG stop flirting with me!" 
* Quotes, metaphors, and math theories galore!

### Watch if you crave a fresh and philosophical romantic drama (and maybe a tear here or there).

## Discussion

The film succeeds in capturing my attention through clever quotes and scenes with impactful meanings. I may have not understood these completely, **I'm just writing how I feel about them**. There were so many, but here are some of my favorites:

### 1. Metaphors
Within the first few scenes, you meet Augustus Waters. Shortly after getting Hazel to watch a movie with him, Gus places a cigarette in his mouth much to Hazel's disgust. He tells her *"It's a metaphor, see. You put the killing thing right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to do it's killing."*
<br><br>
![Metaphor]({{ site.url }}/images/TFIOS/metaphor.jpg)
{: .image-pull-left}
<br>
This was a way for Gus to tell himself that he has control over his fate (up to a certain extent). We all have control over our fate to a certain degree. I found this powerful because our attitude toward of life can make the biggest of impacts. Metaphors give us the positive power to things just by looking at something in a creative way.

### 2. Our Little Infinity

Later in the film, when Gus summons Hazel and Issac to a church so he can listen to their eulogies they prepared for him, Hazel recites a touching piece that represented her love for Gus. She highlighted: *"Some infinities are bigger than other infinities."* (there are an infinite amount of numbers (0.1, 0.11, 0.12) between two domains. Whether it is from 0 to 1 or 0 to a million.) The fact is the infinity between 0 and a million is greater than the infinity between  0 to 1. Hazel and Gus' relationship is time set shorter than other couples, but she **chooses** to see it as an infinity. She acknowledges that she is thankful Gus gave her "forever" (an infinity) within their number of days, their set.
<br><br>
The sets that can drive us insane *(attending a class, being parent, or even growing up)* is a finite amount of hours, days, or years. Hazel's analogy helps bring structure to *clairfy our purpose* and *appraise how we live our life*. I believe in value is in the eye of the beholder. Seeing infinities is rare, but the infinities are the memories I have and will never forget. They bring me peace of mind. So. We can choose to wish we have more numbers or we can make a number set feel like an infinity. With the latter, anything can be an infinity.

### 3. Who Is August Waters?

My friend [Jordyn](http://jordynchung.tumblr.com) shared this post with me from her Tumblr:

> There are 313 pages... We don't meet Augustus until page 8... He does not speak until page 11... He leaves us on page 261... That is 253 pages from when we meet him until he leaves... And within those 253 pages... He is physically in 172 of them... And that is all it took. 172 pages for us to fall in love with Augustus Waters. And none of us will be the same again...

Considering I read this before watching the film. I thought to myself: *what* the hell is this guy? Is he the *perfect* man? Well not exactly. After watching the film, he was the personification of passion. His relentless full-court press attempts for Hazel's heart ws an instinct of his principles. He is understands where he stands in this world and he shapes himself on his own terms. I see him as someone who is truly happy because of decisions bring him some kind of peace. Augutus is a survivor and applies the ideas of heroism and courage from his video games to his life. Generally people adore heroes and feed from courage. With that notion, he became fixated with timeless legacy. But in his last scenes, Hazel comforts him that her care should be enough. Showing him and all of us, there's contentment with being in love with a single person. Contentment is difficult to overcome everyday because of our human desire to be better than people or ourselves. Which the movie speaks to me: we need someone to remind us that we are loved because anyone can be easily consumed by themselves.
<br><br>
Augutus' character uncovered that such great heights are fulfilling. Unfortunately they involve persistent courage and an outrageous amount of thought, hence, why Augutus Waters is a character in a book. Though fictional, anyone can collect what made him inspiration to living a quality way to <strike>cope with</strike> live our lives.
