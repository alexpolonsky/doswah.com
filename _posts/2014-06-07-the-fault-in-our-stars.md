I recently watched the Josh Boone directed *The Fault In Our Stars* with my friends on opening night and I decided to write a spoiler-free review and a spoiler-filled discusison. The film stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort as the teenage duo Hazel Lancaster and Augustus (Gus) Waters. This highly anticipated book-to-film adaptation is a fresh installment that stands out in a plethora of romantic dramas over the years. One thing is for sure, the film's tagline lives up it's name. This definitely *one sick love story.*


**Warning:** Spoilers from the film ahead!

## Review 

I have *not* read the book and this is purely my reaction of just the film. Here is the storyline from [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582846/):

> Hazel and Gus are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous given that Hazel has another other constant companion: an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they met and fell in love at a cancer support group.

### All The Feels

The film's main characters: Hazel (Woodley) and Gus (Elgort) have great chemistry and their strong performances allow the viewer to really buy into their emotions and struggles. The characters attitudes towards life and death keep you strapped on an relentless two hour emotional roller-coaster. Throughout the entire film, the director utilizes lucid scene transitions, maneuvers with a coherent storytelling speed,  and executes the heart-warming (*and especially the heart-breaking*) segments of Hazel's narrative beautifully.
<br><br>
I felt there were missing back stories or deeper meanings in addition to the film having a hint of predictablity. After conveying with readers of the book, the movie did not accomplishe sensitive themes as much as the book did, so I desire to read the book now (*one day*). The film unravels a romance between a girl living in the moment and a boy living in his dream who gives his all relentlessly for the girl he loves. This formula, the struggling girl meets perfect guy, is lovingly set up, but the film's heavy themes could have been expanded on for us who did not read the book to get a deeper understanding of the characters. Nonetheless, the balance of what is included in the film works wonderfully.
<br><br>
The film works with the light-hearted and entertaining scenes. From the throwing eggs at Issac's ex-girlfriend's car, to Issac destroying basketball trophies (*oh Issac*), to Gus' virgin venn diagram. Though nice, the film thrives on sensitive issues. What makes this movie sincere and intimate about these sensitive issues is that the film does not sugarcoat the awful obstacles the charachters encounter. This gave the characters the pHazel handles with herself when she meets her favorite author or Augustus dealing with his tragic health conditions, showed enlightening character growth.

### The Verdict

<i>An incredibly touching,  well-executed film filled with tearjerking moments thanks to powerful performances and a relentless story with timeless thoughts about love, life, and courage that proves a teenage romantic drama can be a small infinty worth every minute.

* I realize why girls "wait" for their Augustus Waters 
* "Okay? Okay. OMG stop flirting with me!" 
* Quotes, metaphors, and math theories galore!

## Discussion

The film succeeds in capturing my attention through clever quotes and scenes with impactful meanings. I may have not understood these compltetly, but I'm just writing how I feel about them. There were so many, but here are some of my favorites:

### 1. Metaphors
Within the first few scenes, you meet Augustus Waters. Shortly after getting Hazel to watch a movie with him, Gus places a cigarette in his mouth much to Hazel's disgust. He tells her *"It's a metaphor, see. You put the killing thing right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to do it's killing."*
<br><br>

<br>
This was a way for Gus to tell himself that he has control over his fate (up to a certain extent). We all have control over our fate to a certain degree. I found this powerful because our attitude toward of life can make the biggests of impacts. It's an idea I hope to never forget.

### 2. Our Little Infinity

Later in the film, when Gus summons Hazel and Issac to a church so he can listen to their eulogies they prepared for him, Hazel recites a touching piece that represnted her love for Gus. She highlighted: *"Some infinities are bigger than other infinities."* I interpreted this part of her eulogy as Hazel explaining there are an infinite amount of numbers (0.1, 0.11, 0.12) between two domains. Whether it is from 0 to 1 or 0 to a million. The fact is the infinity between 0 and a million is greater than the infinity between  0 to 1. Hazel and Gus' relationship has time set than other couples, but she sees it as an infinity. She acknowledges that she is thankful Gus gave her "forever" (an infinity) within their number of days.
<br><br>
When I think about it, we all have number sets. For every aspect of our life. We can choose to wish we have more numbers or we can make a number set feel like an infinity. With the latter, anything can be an infinity. Life. Love. Even a movie. Powerful stuff from a writer than they *used* to like.


**More thoughts coming soon!** including: Augustus Waters, The Inevitability of Human Oblivion, and more metaphors!
