I recently watched the Josh Boone directed *The Fault In Our Stars* with my friends on opening night and I decided to write a review and discusison. If you plan to watch the film with no knowledge about it, do not read on. The film stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort as the teenage duo Hazel Lancaster and Augustus (Gus) Waters. This highly anticipated book-to-film adaptation is a fresh installment that stands out in a plethora of romantic dramas over the years. One thing is for sure, the film's tagline lives up it's name. This definitely *one sick love story.*


**Warning:** Spoilers from the film ahead!

## Review 

I have *not* read the book and this is purely my reaction of just the film. Here is the storyline from [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582846/):

> Hazel and Gus are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous given that Hazel has another other constant companion: an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they met and fell in love at a cancer support group.

### All The Feels

The film's main characters: Hazel (Woodley) and Gus (Elgort) have great chemistry and their strong performances allow the viewer to really buy into their emotions and struggles. The characters attitudes towards life and death keep you strapped on an relentless two hour emotional roller-coaster. Throughout the entire film, the director utilizes lucid scene transitions, maneuvers with a coherent storytelling speed,  and executes the heart-warming (*and especially the heart-breaking*) segments of Hazel's narrative beautifully.
<br><br>
I felt there were missing back stories or deeper meanings in addition to the film having a hint of predictablity. After discussing with readers of the book, the movie did not accomplish sensitive themes as much as the book did, so I desire to read the book now (*one day*). The film unravels a romance between a girl living in the moment and a boy living in his dream who gives his all relentlessly for the girl he loves. This formula, the struggling girl meets the perfect guy, is charmingly set up, but the film's heavy themes could have been expanded on for us who did not read the book to get a deeper understanding of the characters. Why is Augustus the perfect guy from the beginning? Nonetheless, the balance of what is included in the film works wonderfully.
<br><br>
The film works with the light-hearted and entertaining scenes such as virgin venn diagram. Though nice, the film thrives on sensitive issues. What makes this movie sincere and intimate about these sensitive issues is that the film does not sugarcoat the awful obstacles the characters encounter. Above all, it was enlightening to see character growth with beleivable reactions for example how Hazel handled with herself when she meets her favorite author and how Augustus helped his friend Issac in impactful way.

### The Verdict

<i> The Fault In Our Stars is an incredibly touching,  well-executed film filled with tearjerking moments thanks to powerful performances and a relentless story with timeless thoughts about love, life, and courage that proves a teenage romantic drama can be a small infinty worth every moment.

* I realize why girls "wait" for their Augustus Waters 
* "Okay? Okay. OMG stop flirting with me!" 
* Quotes, metaphors, and math theories galore!

### Watch if you crave a fresh and philosophical romantic drama (and maybe a tear here or there).

## Discussion

The film succeeds in capturing my attention through clever quotes and scenes with impactful meanings. I may have not understood these completely, **I'm just writing how I feel about them**. There were so many, but here are some of my favorites:

### 1. Metaphors
Within the first few scenes, you meet Augustus Waters. Shortly after getting Hazel to watch a movie with him, Gus places a cigarette in his mouth much to Hazel's disgust. He tells her *"It's a metaphor, see. You put the killing thing right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to do it's killing."*
<br><br>

<br>
This was a way for Gus to tell himself that he has control over his fate (up to a certain extent). We all have control over our fate to a certain degree. I found this powerful because our attitude toward of life can make the biggests of impacts. Metaphors give us the positive power to things just by looking at something in a creative way.

### 2. Our Little Infinity

Later in the film, when Gus summons Hazel and Issac to a church so he can listen to their eulogies they prepared for him, Hazel recites a touching piece that represnted her love for Gus. She highlighted: *"Some infinities are bigger than other infinities."* I interpreted this part of her eulogy as Hazel explaining there are an infinite amount of numbers (0.1, 0.11, 0.12) between two domains. Whether it is from 0 to 1 or 0 to a million. The fact is the infinity between 0 and a million is greater than the infinity between  0 to 1. Hazel and Gus' relationship is time set shorter than other couples, but she 'chooses' to seeit as an infinity. She acknowledges that she is thankful Gus gave her "forever" (an infinity) within their number of days.
<br><br>
When I think about it, we all have number sets. For every aspect of our life. We can choose to wish we have more numbers or we can make a number set feel like an infinity. With the latter, anything can be an infinity. Life. Love. Or a juicy 12 oz steak. Mmm.

### 3. Who Is August Waters?

My friend [Jordyn](http://jordynchung.tumblr.com) shared this post with me from her Tumblr:

> There are 313 pages... We don't meet Augustus until page 8... He does not speak until page 11... He leaves us on page 261... That is 253 pages from when we meet him until he leaves... And within those 253 pages... He is physically in 172 of them... And that is all it took. 172 pages for us to fall in love with Augustus Waters. And none of us will be the same again...

Considering I read this before watching the film. I thought to myself: *what* the hell is this guy? Is he the *perfect* man? Well not exactly. After watching the film, he was the personification of passion. His relentless full-court press attempts for Hazel's heart is an instinct of his principles. He is a cancer patient who knows where he stands in this world and it shapes who he is on his own terms by looking into reasons how he lives his life.
<br><br>
Augustus immediately shows interest in Hazel shortly after their discusion on the 'Inevitablility of Human Oblivion' at the support group.  Hazel is agitated and he clashes with someone who is as confident with their ideals as him. Like I mentioned in the review, she lives in the moment and he lives in a dream. Their conviction is their attraction When they finally digest each other, they bring out the most of each other's strengths.
<br><br>
Augutus is a suvivor and aplies the ideas of heroism and courage from his video games to his life. Generally people adore heroes and feed from courage. With that notion, he became fixated with timeless legacy. But in his last scenes, Hazel comforts him that her care should be enough. Showing him and all of us, there's contentment with being in love with a single person.
<br><br>
Augutus' character uncovered that such great heights are fulfilling. Unfortunately they involve persistent courage and an outragrous amount of thought, hence, why Augutus Waters is a character in a book. Though fictional, you can pick out what made him to be believable. In turn, giving us hope and guidance to a higher quality way to <strike>cope with</strike> live our lives.
