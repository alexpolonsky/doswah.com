Las Vegas. The Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. A stop on Ed Sheeran's *Multiply* tour. 
Rudimental opened up performing hits: *Free*, *Waiting All Night*, *Feel The Love*, and *Not Giving In*. 
Definitely check these guys out, they were loud, upbeat, and knew how to party.
<br><br> 
The chants grew... "Ed! Ed! Ed!" He walks out with a grin and says... 
"Hey, I'm Ed. My job is to entertain you for the next two hours. It's your job to 
be entertained. Well... for the next two hours." 
<br><br>
An Ed Sheeran show is simple. No dancers, no background singers, no band, but instead, two microphones, 
a loop pedal, and his guitar. His setlist composed of his hits first two albums, *+* (Plus) and *x* (Multiply).

It was a great concert considering it was a one-man show. Loud acoustics and beat-boxing compiled 
into a great show that ranks as one of the best concerts I have been to. Lastly, here is a clip 
from the concert of "Thinking Out Loud." Enjoy.
