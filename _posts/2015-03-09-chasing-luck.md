I am an huge fan of NBC's Parks and Recreation and one my favorite episodes are when Ben and his friends each do something they have always wanted to do for their bachelor's party (but didn't have an opportunity to). Andy told his friends his impossible dream is to "catch a touchdown in the Super Bowl and watch the Colts beat the Patriots 49-nothing". Then the spectacular happened:

This weekend, a variety of celebrities for a USO Tour to show their appreciation for the U.S. Armed Services. The list of celebrities included Andrew Luck, Chuck Pagano, and Dwayne Allen of the Indianapolis Colts.
<br><br>
The USO Tour made a stop at Pearl Harbor so [Jake](http://twitter.com/jaketsuyemura) had a great idea to check out the event and enjoy the festivities. Jake is a huge Colts fan, it would be a great opportunity to meet the Colts players and their Head Coach.

There was a huge stage setup and various food vendors making it a great event for families. I forgot my football in car, when I went I came back, Andrew Luck was meeting and autographing for fans. The only thing I had was a football I would throw around with friends when I went to UH and ironically it was deflated.

After a few minutes of waiting, I got chance to meet Mr. Luck, thank him for his contribution with this Tour and everything he has done for the Colts organization. It was tremendous.

No such thing as an impossible dream.
