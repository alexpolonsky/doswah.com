Two years ago in attempts for IEEE student branch off-campus adventures. Several club members thought it would be great to go on a easy, paved hike: the Makapu'u Lighthouse Trail. But little did they know, I discovered what iMovie was. Here was the result: <i>Lighthouse</i>

I thought of it as a comedic promotional video to generate interest in other club members to join future hikes. Safe to say - there were no hikes were planned for the next several months. 
<br><br>
The critics applauded the randomness of <i>Lighthouse</i> and the video gathered 15+ views on Vimeo. I booked my flight back to Hawaii for a real hike. Unfortunately, that hike got rained out on the day we planned. So we all decided on the one hike nearby that didn't get rained out.

Lighthouse has grown into a big hit among a few people. The actors have yet to begin neogotion for a third film (trailer) with no release date set. Shooting begins sometime in Europe 2017.
