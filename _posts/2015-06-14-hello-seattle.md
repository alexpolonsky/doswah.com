<br>
In early April, I was offered an opportunity for change. A different career lied ahead of me but more importantly a new place. With the idea of exploring life away from the place I called home on my mind for days, I made the decision to go into a career in software testing. Filled with hope and aspirations, I bought a one-way ticket and on April 3rd I flew over 2500 miles to the Evergreen state.
