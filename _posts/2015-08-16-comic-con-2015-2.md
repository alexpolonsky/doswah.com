There was a big day ahead of us. Doctor Who NerdHQ panel and Conan. I had trouble containing my excitement. In attempts to get good seats we stood in the box office line at 2:00 am. It resulted in a good idea because we ended up with third row seats!

## NerdHQ

After we got out tickets, we headed toward the NerdHQ building. Karlo scored tickets to a QA featuring Jenna Coleman, Steven Moffatt, and Michelle Gomez. As we get in, Zachary Levi greets us; looking disappointed, he sadly admitted he was unable to moderate the panel. That someone else wanted to moderate a talk where all whovians wish they would be. In walks Captain Mal!

He expressed how excited he is to do a Doctor Who panel. After Jenna, Steven, and Michelle walked in Mr. Fillon says it would be a shame to do a Doctor Who panel -- without the doctor. In walks Peter Capaldi!

There they were: the Doctor, Clara, the notorious showrunner, and Master. The talk was surreal; Peter childishly explained his favorite unorthodox fairy tale, Jenna adorably answered questions about her favorite moments filming, Steven expressed his love to what the Doctor means to him, and Michelle answered exactly like Missy would - with soul piercing stares.

## ConanCon
After the talk Karlo and I met up with Damo at a japanese restaurant next to the Spreckles Theatre, where Conan was shooting his show. Sushi and sake bombs for get us prepared for arguably the best show in late night.

We get inside the theatre and realizing how close we were to where Conan will do his monologue and interviews was heart pumping. Before the show started. someone part of Conan's crew wanted to get the crowd pumped up with a dance off before the show started. After jumping on my seat like a wild 8-year-old trying to get him to pick me, I got the finger point so I sprinted to the stage.

I killed it.

The show was amazing. There were secret guest appearances from Peter Capaldi with a TARDIS and Liam Cunningham (Davos from Game of Thrones). The main guests were the cast of X-Men Apocoplypse; the Michael Fassbender/ James McAvoy bromance was amusing and Olivia Munn was alluring as always.

This capped our an action-packed day. We headed back to the room, ordered udon room delivery, and called it an early night. Surviving on an average of 4 hours of sleep for the past 4 days, it was a well needed night in.

## Last Day of Comic Con

We made it to the last stretch. Exahusted yet fulfilled with all that already happened. We still had badges for Sunday so we decided to walk aorund the exhibit hall for a few hours to check out any booths we might have missed on Thursday. We headed back to the hotel to pack all the swag then headed to the airport for drinks.

Getting to see abundant cosplay and surround ourselves with others as passionate about what Comic Con means to them gets me excited to the next Comic Con.
