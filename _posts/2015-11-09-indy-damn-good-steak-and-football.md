Four guys ventured to Indianapolis, Indiana to embark on a weekend of food and football. To dine at St. Elmos Steakhouse and withess Denver Broncos vs. Indianapolis Colts for Week 9 action of NFL football. It was me, Jake, Karlo, and Damo - a Bronco fan, Colts fan, Eagles fan, and the guy who promised the Colts guy Colts tickets.

## Chicago Rendezvous
The Washingtonians met up with the Hawaiian in Chicago for a 4-hour layover in the morning. So why not buy a pizza? Albeit, in an airport food court, I tried my first Chicago deep dish pizza. I hope to be back for Bears or Bulls game - Chicago looks like a prime spot for picture-taking.


## Indy Arrival
On our way to the city we caught a peek the 1.8 million square feet mammoth that is Lucas Oil Stadium. Still early in afternoon, we decided to explore the capital of Indiana.

We arrived in the city and trotted on foot to soak in Indianapolis. We parked along circled Monument Circle in the heart of downtown in awe to the nearly 300 foot tall [Soldiers and Sailors Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldiers%27_and_Sailors%27_Monument_(Indianapolis)).

This city was spacious and rich in government buildings and historic monuments. We saw the [Indiana World War Memorial Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_World_War_Memorial_Plaza) among other popular landmarks. When in a new city, my method is to open *Yelp* and go to the nearest 4-star or higher places. So we ended up at Sun King Brewery for beer flights (Wee Mac was my personal favorite!) Then we suppressed our hunger with White Castle until dinner.


## The Steakhouse at St. Elmo

As an avid fan of NBC's Parks and Recreation, a trip to to Indy would only feel complete if we dined at St. Elmo's Steakhouse. Dudes night out - it's what you do.

We chowed down on the most scrumpdeliumptous steak Indy had to offer. Before our steaks we ordered the world-famous sinus-clearing Shrimp Cocktails. But I'll remember them as **eye-tearing**. I failed to remember the "sinus-clearing" part and took a relentless bite of shrimp drenched with cocktail sauce. My squinting, tear-eyed face caught the attention of nearby guests. But I reassured them a thumbs up for I was in a marvelous state of in pain and happiness. 
<br><br>
I ordered a chefs special and I can confidently say this was the greatest steak I've had the pleasure of feasting on. The first few bites made me reminisce on how my dad use to cook steaks when the family would throw BBQs (Picture the [scene from Ratatouille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YG4h5GbTqU) when the food critic was reminded how his mother cooked him the same thing). This feeling-inducing steak excelled at being a steak so much, eating it resurfaced treasured memories. When I looked up the whole party was enjoying their slabs of steak too with quiet and smiling nods. I wished I had a Polaroid Instant Camera so I could capture the moment and have a keepsake.

## Colts & Broncos

Gameday. I suited up my Manning jersey and Broncos beanie then made way to the House Peyton Built. Jake bought his Colts jersey, Karlo got his Colts beanie and we partook in the festivities around the stadium hours before kickoff.

Suddenly we were in Lucas Oil Stadium; the stadium that Peyton Built. It's a surreal feeling to be somewhere you only see on TV or in Madden. The abundance of diehard fans with their jerseys and makeup was the culture that I've always wanted to live within.

I became a Broncos fan in the late 90s when Elway made his last two seasons Super Bowl winning ones. As a side thought, I have a theory which says: given when a person starts being a fan (or at least starts watching) of football. The dominant, championship team defaults to their favorite team. (Think about the surge of Seattle Seahawk fans) To prove my point, if you're my age, I would guess your parents, uncles, or aunties are either Cowboys, Raiders, or 49er fans. Well, there is also the scenario where it's solely based on the team's uniforms colors. Fortunately for me, both cases clicked with me. 
<br><br>
We got to our seats, 50-yard line nosebleeds an hour before kickoff. Bratwursts and BBQ in hand, we were ready for four quarters of Colts vs. Broncos.

We helped keep the stadium loud. Jake, Karlo, and Damo took pleasure, along with all the Colt fans, in chanting first downs to me as the Colts moved the chains.

The Colts won. 27-24. <br><br>
Although the Broncos lost, the game was filled with highlights: an epic Omar Bolden 83-yard kick off return as time expired in the first half, a 64-yard Manning to Sanders touchdown, and Aquib Talib going all Captain Insano on Dwayne Allen.

To add the moment, this year I assembled my Fantasy Football team around Colts and Broncos (knowing we were going to this game before the season started). As a result nearly my entire fantasy football team that week were either Colts or Broncos players. It would have been amazing if I won, given it was such a audaciously bold play. But seeing my points tally up in real time was surreal on its own. 
<br><br>
There are times in movies or TV when a group of people have the time of their lives, someone says something along of the lines of: "We should keep doing this." Jake stirred the idea of the crew traveling to watch a game at *every* football stadium in the NFL. Now, The NY Jets and NY Giants share MetLife Stadium. That's still 31 total stadiums...

Only 30 more to go.
