The matchup that has sent shivers down my sign for years. The team my heart has tirelessly rooted for since the start of my love for football (which is a story for another day) was labeled as underdogs to the titan New England Patriots. Being in the pacific northwest, I've never been closer to watching a Broncos home game in Denver. It crossed my mind it may very well be last year of conference championships, home-field advantages, and "Omahas!". The window was closing and as many know: the carousel of NFL dominance does not come so easily.

The night before the game, I bought round-trip tickets to the rocky mountains of Denver, Colorado. Hey, if it's not too late - then you can still do it. After my two-hour flight and a lovely converstion with big Mike (my Uber driver) about rocky mountain oysters and prairie dogs, I found myself surrounded by a sea of orange and nothing could steal the grin from my face.

I stood among statues of Broncos hall-of-game and the great Pat Bowlen. As I my expensive credentials granted into the stadium, my heart sank with awe in the sights and sounds. Players from the championship teams were here - Sharpe, Davis, and more. Also in attendance were T.I.and Standford phenom running back Christian McCaffrey. It hit me. I was finally here - amongst thousands with the singular purpose: kick and scream their beloved Broncos to the Super Bowl.

National Anthem was sung by Andy Grammer and kickoff started. I blew up my snapchat throughout the game because was on the edge of my seat with every ticking minute going by. I've attended a Seahawks regular-season game at Century Link Field, known to be the loudest stadium in the NFL. This Broncos crowd that was even *louder*. Every defensive possession, fans were on their feet - shouted to the top of their lungs. There were five pre-snap offensive penalties by the Patriots - I witnessed the power of home field advantage. I cheered "IN-COM-PLETE!" as Brady's passes didn't connect. In what proved to be a valuable possession, I put on my Broncos beanie at the 2 minute warning - Manning marched the offense which led to a McManus field goal to end the half.

Halftime. 17-9, Broncos up. The American Authors were halftime entertainment. They performed "Pride" (featured in the video) and "Best Day of My Life". Fitting. Feeling on the top of the world.
<br><br>
Then the roller coaster of emotion came: 4th quater came. A sense of reality started taking shape. We were up 8 points with less than a minute to go. But the dread of giving up a win at the end is a feeling I've witnessed too many times - please, not today. After converting possession after possession, Gronk caught a pass in the endzone from Tom Brady on a 4th and goal with :12 to go to pull the Pats only two-points away from overtime. The crowed screamed and cursed in horror. On the two-point conversion, Gronk failed to catch a lob to the back of the endzone by Brady. The crowed screamed and cursed in relief. 18-20, Broncos. Everyone held their breath on the onside kick.

Orange, blue, and white confetti filled the sky. I was feeling a mile high. Literally too (the stadium is 5280 feet above sea level). To be part of something so magical justified making this journey. Pat Bowlen, Broncos owner, stepped down from CEO duties this year because he was underoing symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. As his wife Annabel accepted the Lamar Hunt trophy, she glared up at the stands, then at the players and shouts "Let's get it done for Pat and Go Broncos!"

Win or lose, I was surrounded by Broncos fans who I've rode this roller coaster all season with. I high fived dozens of strangers and I felt like I belong where I needed to be that day.

As night fell, the stadium emptied. Everyone took their cars, shuttles, and flights home. The season was not over for this franchise and their fans. Broncos Country were on their way to Santa Clara, California for their chance to take home the Lombardi trophy back to Denver.
